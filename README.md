# Kat Fukui—@katmeister
Hi, I'm Kat—a senior product designer at GitHub working on [Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) to support open source sustainability. Previously worked on the Community & Safety team to help communities grow welcoming and productive spaces. I'm a huge nerd/geek, Splatoon 2 + ACNH player, and aspiring aerialist. 💕

## My values
🌟 Expression as authentic self<br>
💖 Safety and trust<br>
🍏 Beginner's mindset and curiosity<br>
🙌 Shared understanding and consensus

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 😸
